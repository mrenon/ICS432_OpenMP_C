V2:
AVERAGE TOTAL EXECUTION TIME: 70.776 SECS
AVERAGE TOTAL IMBALANCE TIME: 48.843 SECS

V3:
AVERAGE TOTAL EXECUTION TIME: 71.759 SECS
AVERAGE TOTAL IMBALANCE TIME: 57.659 SECS

as for the total execution time we see little change in time, but actually we can see a big difference when it comes to load imbalance between the 2 versions, there is more load imbalance in V3 this is probably because of the switching and telling each thread to get something new everytime it finishes

as for the times, i feel that i am calculating them wrong, but if in the case they are correct, i feel that it is so high because i am running off Ubuntu on a VM and that my computer is around 5 years old.
